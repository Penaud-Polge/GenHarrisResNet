GenHarris-ResNet architecture: The first part of the proposed network
is equivariant to rotation and is composed of several feature function blocks
arranged in a ResNet configuration. Then, the feature maps are given to the
global extrema pooling layer which brings the invariance property. A dense layer
ends the network.
